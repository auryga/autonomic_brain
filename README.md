Code in Python to time-series analysis

Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) affects millions of people worldwide each year. Its effect is multi-system disorders, long-term complications difficult to predict and high mortality. On the other hand the complexity of biological signals requires the use of advanced and optimally selected methods mathematics. The innovative nature of the project is to investigate the relationship between disability of the autonomic nervous system and cerebral autoregulation in the context of treatment outcomes and predictions mortality after TBI using advanced algorithms and statistical learning methods machine.
